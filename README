Some utilities to help git-svn users who commit to MediaWiki. 

For instance, you can cd to your $IP directory ( the one containing your LocalSettings.php ) and execute this:

    extsFromLs LocalSettings.php | xargs gitSvnExts --replace

Assuming you have a typical layout (your extensions are in "extensions") this will replace all your extension directories
with git repos. CAUTION: using --replace blows away any local changes.

If you just want a new git repo for an extension, in that extensions directory:

    gitSvnExts MyNewExtension

This will be obsolete when MediaWiki makes the final move to git, of course, since a similar structure will exist already.
