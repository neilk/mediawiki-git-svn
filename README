This will be obsolete when MediaWiki makes the final move to git. In the meantime here are some utilities to help git-svn users develop extensions.

Many svn committers have the entire extensions directory in their tree. This is impractical with git, assuming you want to also have the local history.

So, you really want a sparse set of extensions that you care about.  Here's an incantation to get all the extensions currently require'd in your LocalSettings, and
transform them into git repos:

    extsFromLs LocalSettings.php | xargs gitSvnExts --replace

CAUTION: using --replace blows away any local changes.

If you just want to download a new git repo for an extension, cd to $IP and say:

    gitSvnExts MyNewExtension

For people with more unusual setups, gitSvnExts has a number of options. To read the documentation, just type:

    gitSvnExts
