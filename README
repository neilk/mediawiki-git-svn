This will be obsolete when MediaWiki makes the final move to git. In the meantime here are some utilities to help git-svn users develop extensions.

Many svn committers have the entire extensions directory in their tree. This is impractical with git, because you must download every revision since
the beginning of time. So, you really want a sparse set of extensions that you care about.

So, here's an incantation to get all the extensions currently require'd in your LocalSettings:

    extsFromLs LocalSettings.php | xargs gitSvnExts --replace

Assuming you have a typical layout (your extensions are in "extensions") this will replace all the extensions you are using with
git repos. 

CAUTION: using --replace blows away any local changes.

If you just want to download a new git repo for an extension, cd to $IP and say:

    gitSvnExts MyNewExtension

gitSvnExts has a number of options. To read the documentation, just type:

    gitSvnExts
