A utility to help git-svn users who commit to MediaWiki. 

For instance, to help create an extensions directory with one git repo for each extension that you need. Or to install new 
extensions from git into that directory.

This will be obsolete when MediaWiki makes the final move to git, of course, since a similar structure will exist already.
